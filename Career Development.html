							Abaarso Tech University works with its sister organization, Institute for Practical Research and Training in establishing a Career Development office that can help students in making career decisions that are consistent with their unique talents, aspirations, and skills. Staff from IPRT will help students discover links between their personal traits and career options through individual counseling.</p>
							<p>All students can receive training in resume and cover letter writing as well as interview and job search techniques. They are also able to participate in job training programs held periodically by IPRT that will help place them in jobs across the private sector. Students and alumni can access a wide range of employment opportunities at IPRT’s annual skill’s training seminars where a career team led by the organization’s senior executives are available to consult for advice and support throughout your career.</p>
